    "# What is CyVerse?\n",
    "\n",
    "CyVerse started out in 2008 as the NSF-funded 'iPlant Collaborative' project to help the changing needs of the life sciences, which have increasingly heavy computational demands (think protein folding, genetic phenotyping, etc. etc.), but have historically not had high-performance computing facilities. The project was rechristened 'CyVerse' in 2015.\n",
    "\n",
    "The two co-I's of the grant, Nirav Merchant and Eric Lyons, are life scientists here at UA and offer the course \"Applied Concepts in Cyberinfrastructure\". They had found that researchers were \"actively avoiding advanced computing for their research projects because they viewed it as inflexible, complicated, frustrating, and time-consuming.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "CyVerse offers:\n",
    "1.    Cloud computing\n",
    "2.    Data storage\n",
    "3.    Support"

    "# Why should an astronomer care about it?\n",
    "\n",
    "CyVerse cyberinfrastructure has the serendipitous effect of providing computational resources to basically anyone here at UA and >8,000 participating institutions. \n",
    "\n",
    "Possible reasons to care: \n",
    "1.    If you have computational needs that are greater than what your office machines can provide, but less than what would usually pass for HPC jobs\n",
    "2.    If you want to calculate something now, and don't want to put your job in a queue\n",
    "3.    Very flexible for access remotely or from low-performance machines (basically all you need to do is 'ssh')\n",
    "\n",
    "I (Eckhart) first heard about it at a <a href=https://uhilgert.github.io/2018-02-10-Tucson/>Software Carpentry</a> workshop. CyVerse made a brief appearance at a talk at the Internal Symposium in fall 2016. \n",
    "\n",
    "Using CyVerse computational resources, I performed MCMC and image-processing-related computations for three publications either published or in prep.). Using resources for which I did not require any extra human approval, it has shortened high-contrast imaging dataset reductions from >10 hours of wall time to ~30-40 minutes by distributing the jobs across several cores.\n",
    "\n",
    "Ya-Lin Wu (grad student close to graduating) and Jared Males (new research professor here) used CyVerse to do image processing involving frame-by-frame parameterization and subtraction of host star PSFs, and brightness determination with fake planet injection. In Males' case, this shortened reduction times from four months to two days. (This was actually a project of the \"Applied Concepts in Cyberinfrastructure\" class.)\n",
